# Stack and Queue

## Stack 

* A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.

* Common terminology for a stack is:

1- Push - Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed.

2- Pop - Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped. When you attempt to pop an empty stack an exception will be raised.

3- Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack. When you attempt to peek an empty stack an exception will be raised.

4- IsEmpty - returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.

## Queue

* Common terminology for a queue is:

1- Enqueue - Nodes or items that are added to the queue.

2- Dequeue - Nodes or items that are removed from the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.

4- Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the front Node in the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.

5- IsEmpty - returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.
